## Philosophy

> *"Music is the space between the notes."*
> — Claude Debussy

Electronic music didn't begin in a Berlin nightclub. It began wherever someone first asked: *can a machine make sound that moves people?*

**The lineage is global.** In the 1940s and 50s, musique concrète (Paris) and elektronische Musik (Cologne) proved that recorded and synthesized sound could be art. By the 1960s, Robert Moog's synthesizer put those sounds into the hands of musicians. Kraftwerk fused it with pop. Detroit techno gave it soul. And the dance floor became a laboratory.

**India was there from the start.** In the late 1960s, the **National Institute of Design (NID) in Ahmedabad** built one of the country's first electronic music studios, where composers like **Gita Sarabhai**, **I.S. Mathur**, and **Jinraj Joshipura** experimented with Moog synthesizers and tape machines — work recently rediscovered and released as the *NID Tapes: Electronic Music from India 1969–1972*. In 1982, **Charanjit Singh** released *Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat*, an album that fused Indian classical ragas with the Roland TB-303 — predating acid house by half a decade and now considered a proto-acid house classic worldwide.

**Then came live coding.** The idea that *writing code* could be a performance — improvised, visible, vulnerable — emerged from the academic fringes (TOPLAP, founded 2004) and grew into **Algorave**, a global movement where programmers make music for dance floors in real time. The tools followed: **TidalCycles** (Haskell, by Alex McLean), **Sonic Pi**, **FoxDot**, and finally **Strudel** — which brought it all into the browser with zero setup.

**India embraced it.** In 2018, **Algorave India** — founded by **Abhinay Khoparzi** and **Dhanya Pilo** — began organizing live coding concerts, workshops, and community events across the country, bridging computational art with India's deep musical traditions. Today, Indian live coders perform with Strudel, TidalCycles, and SuperCollider at venues and festivals that didn't exist a decade ago.

This course exists at the intersection of all these threads: the experimental spirit of the NID studio, the rhythmic sophistication of Indian music, the radical transparency of live coding, and the accessibility of the browser. You're not just learning a tool — you're joining a lineage.

---

**Breath of Strudel** is a self-paced course that takes you from absolute zero to performing and producing complete electronic music — using nothing but [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/), a free, browser-based live coding environment. No software to install. No plugins to buy. Just open a tab and start making music.

The course covers **four pillars** that every electronic musician needs: the tools to make sound, the theory to understand it, the design to shape it, and the structure to arrange it into something people want to listen to.

By the end, you'll have built a full **Minimal Techno** track from scratch and have the skills to perform it live.

## Who This Course Is For

You belong here if any of these describe you:

- 🎵 **Complete beginners** — you've never made electronic music before
- 💻 **Programmers curious about music** — you know code but not chords
- 🎹 **Musicians new to live coding** — you make music but want to try a code-based approach
- 🎧 **Techno fans** who want to understand how their favourite tracks are built

> [!NOTE]
> **No prior music knowledge is required.** This course teaches music theory as you need it — intervals, scales, chords, arrangement — all in context, all with immediately audible results.

---

## What You'll Need

```

### 🔧 Tools — *How to talk to the machine*
The **Strudel REPL**, mini-notation, pattern language, `$:` labels, keyboard shortcuts, MIDI output, visual feedback. Everything you need to operate the instrument.

### 🎼 Theory — *Why certain notes sound good together*
Cycles and tempo, scales (minor, pentatonic, dorian, phrygian), intervals, chord construction, voicings, voice leading, transposition. Not "textbook theory" — practical theory that makes your music sound better, immediately.

### 🎛️ Design — *How to sculpt sound*
Oscillators, filters, envelopes, FM synthesis, wavetables, samples, drum machines, effects (delay, reverb, distortion, sidechain), dynamics (compression, gain staging). You'll design every sound from scratch.

### 🏗️ Arrangement — *How to turn loops into music*
Song structure (intro, build, drop, breakdown, outro), transitions (filter sweeps, risers, fades), energy dynamics, layering constructs (`stack`, `cat`, `arrange`), and live performance workflow.

### Tips for Beginners

> [!TIP]
> **Paste and play first, understand second.** Every code example in this course can be copied directly into [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/). Press `Ctrl+Enter` and *listen*. Then read the explanation. Your ears will teach you faster than your eyes.

> [!TIP]
> **Change one thing at a time.** See a number in a code example? Change it. Listen to what happens. Change it back. This is the fastest way to build intuition for what every parameter does.

> [!TIP]
> **Don't skip the exercises.** Each module ends with practice challenges. These aren't homework — they're where the real learning happens. The solutions are hidden behind `<details>` dropdowns if you get stuck.

> [!TIP]
> **It's okay to sound bad.** Your first sounds will be rough. That's normal. Every producer's first kick sounded terrible. The course takes you from terrible to polished — trust the process.

## Quick-Start: Your First 5 Minutes

If you want to hear something *right now*, do this:

**1. Open [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/)**

**2. Delete everything in the editor and paste this:**

```js
setcpm(128/4)
s("bd*4, hh*8, ~ cp ~ cp").bank("RolandTR909")
```

**3. Press `Ctrl+Enter` (or click Play)**

You just made a techno beat. The kick (`bd`) hits 4 times per cycle. Hi-hats (`hh`) hit 8 times. The clap (`cp`) hits on beats 2 and 4. All from a single line of code.

**4. Now paste this and press `Ctrl+Enter`:**

```js
setcpm(128/4)

$: s("bd*4").bank("RolandTR909")
$: s("hh*16").bank("RolandTR909").gain(".5 .3 .8 .3").hpf(6000)
$: s("~ cp ~ cp").bank("RolandTR909").room(0.15)
$: note("[c2 c2 <eb2 f2> c2]*2").s("sawtooth")
  .lpf(400).lpq(12).ftype("ladder")
  .decay(0.2).sustain(0)
$: note("<[c4,eb4,g4] [bb3,d4,f4]>").s("sawtooth")
  .lpf(2000).attack(0.3).release(1)
  .room(0.4).gain(0.2)
```

That's a full minimal techno groove — kick, hi-hats, clap, acid bass, and a dark chord pad — in 10 lines of code. This is what you'll learn to build from scratch.

**5. Press `Ctrl+.` to stop. Start Module 1.**

## Appendices

### A. Strudel Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Enter` | **Evaluate all code** — your "play/update" button |
| `Ctrl+.` | **Hush** — stop all sound instantly (emergency stop) |

> **Note:** Strudel evaluates *all* code at once — there is no block evaluation shortcut. To selectively mute parts, prefix a `$:` pattern with `_` (e.g. `_$: s("hh*8")`) to silence it.
