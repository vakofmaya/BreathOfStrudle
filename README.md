## Philosophy

> *"Music is the space between the notes."*
> — Claude Debussy

Electronic music didn't begin in a Berlin nightclub. It began wherever someone first asked: *can a machine make sound that moves people?*

**The lineage is global.** In the 1940s and 50s, musique concrète (Paris) and elektronische Musik (Cologne) proved that recorded and synthesized sound could be art. By the 1960s, Robert Moog's synthesizer put those sounds into the hands of musicians. Kraftwerk fused it with pop. Detroit techno gave it soul. And the dance floor became a laboratory.

**India was there from the start.** In the late 1960s, the **National Institute of Design (NID) in Ahmedabad** built one of the country's first electronic music studios, where composers like **Gita Sarabhai**, **I.S. Mathur**, and **Jinraj Joshipura** experimented with Moog synthesizers and tape machines — work recently rediscovered and released as the *NID Tapes: Electronic Music from India 1969–1972*. In 1982, **Charanjit Singh** released *Ten Ragas to a Disco Beat*, an album that fused Indian classical ragas with the Roland TB-303 — predating acid house by half a decade and now considered a proto-acid house classic worldwide.

**Then came live coding.** The idea that *writing code* could be a performance — improvised, visible, vulnerable — emerged from the academic fringes (TOPLAP, founded 2004) and grew into **Algorave**, a global movement where programmers make music for dance floors in real time. The tools followed: **TidalCycles** (Haskell, by Alex McLean), **Sonic Pi**, **FoxDot**, and finally **Strudel** — which brought it all into the browser with zero setup.

**India embraced it.** In 2018, **Algorave India** — founded by **Abhinay Khoparzi** and **Dhanya Pilo** — began organizing live coding concerts, workshops, and community events across the country, bridging computational art with India's deep musical traditions. Today, Indian live coders perform with Strudel, TidalCycles, and SuperCollider at venues and festivals that didn't exist a decade ago.

This course exists at the intersection of all these threads: the experimental spirit of the NID studio, the rhythmic sophistication of Indian music, the radical transparency of live coding, and the accessibility of the browser. You're not just learning a tool — you're joining a lineage.

---

**Breath of Strudel** is a self-paced course that takes you from absolute zero to performing and producing complete electronic music — using nothing but [Strudel](https://strudel.cc/), a free, browser-based live coding environment. No software to install. No plugins to buy. Just open a tab and start making music.

The course covers **four pillars** that every electronic musician needs: the tools to make sound, the theory to understand it, the design to shape it, and the structure to arrange it into something people want to listen to.

By the end, you'll have built a full **Minimal Techno** track from scratch and have the skills to perform it live.

---

## Who This Course Is For

You belong here if any of these describe you:

- 🎵 **Complete beginners** — you've never made electronic music before
- 💻 **Programmers curious about music** — you know code but not chords
- 🎹 **Musicians new to live coding** — you make music but want to try a code-based approach
- 🎧 **Techno fans** who want to understand how their favourite tracks are built

> [!NOTE]
> **No prior music knowledge is required.** This course teaches music theory as you need it — intervals, scales, chords, arrangement — all in context, all with immediately audible results.

---

## What You'll Need

| Requirement | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Browser** | Chromium-based (Chrome, Brave, Edge) recommended for best audio performance |
| **Headphones** | Any headphones — you need to hear low frequencies clearly |
| **Time** | ~2–4 hours per module, self-paced |
| **That's it** | No DAW, no plugins, no installs, no money. Just [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/) |

```

### 🔧 Tools — *How to talk to the machine*
The **Strudel REPL**, mini-notation, pattern language, `$:` labels, keyboard shortcuts, MIDI output, visual feedback. Everything you need to operate the instrument.

### 🎼 Theory — *Why certain notes sound good together*
Cycles and tempo, scales (minor, pentatonic, dorian, phrygian), intervals, chord construction, voicings, voice leading, transposition. Not "textbook theory" — practical theory that makes your music sound better, immediately.

### 🎛️ Design — *How to sculpt sound*
Oscillators, filters, envelopes, FM synthesis, wavetables, samples, drum machines, effects (delay, reverb, distortion, sidechain), dynamics (compression, gain staging). You'll design every sound from scratch.

### 🏗️ Arrangement — *How to turn loops into music*
Song structure (intro, build, drop, breakdown, outro), transitions (filter sweeps, risers, fades), energy dynamics, layering constructs (`stack`, `cat`, `arrange`), and live performance workflow.

### Tips for Beginners

> [!TIP]
> **Paste and play first, understand second.** Every code example in this course can be copied directly into [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/). Press `Ctrl+Enter` and *listen*. Then read the explanation. Your ears will teach you faster than your eyes.

> [!TIP]
> **Change one thing at a time.** See a number in a code example? Change it. Listen to what happens. Change it back. This is the fastest way to build intuition for what every parameter does.

> [!TIP]
> **Don't skip the exercises.** Each module ends with practice challenges. These aren't homework — they're where the real learning happens. The solutions are hidden behind `<details>` dropdowns if you get stuck.

> [!TIP]
> **It's okay to sound bad.** Your first sounds will be rough. That's normal. Every producer's first kick sounded terrible. The course takes you from terrible to polished — trust the process.

## Quick-Start: Your First 5 Minutes

If you want to hear something *right now*, do this:

**1. Open [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/)**

**2. Delete everything in the editor and paste this:**

```js
setcpm(128/4)
s("bd*4, hh*8, ~ cp ~ cp").bank("RolandTR909")
```

**3. Press `Ctrl+Enter` (or click Play)**

You just made a techno beat. The kick (`bd`) hits 4 times per cycle. Hi-hats (`hh`) hit 8 times. The clap (`cp`) hits on beats 2 and 4. All from a single line of code.

**4. Now paste this and press `Ctrl+Enter`:**

```js
setcpm(128/4)

$: s("bd*4").bank("RolandTR909")
$: s("hh*16").bank("RolandTR909").gain(".5 .3 .8 .3").hpf(6000)
$: s("~ cp ~ cp").bank("RolandTR909").room(0.15)
$: note("[c2 c2 <eb2 f2> c2]*2").s("sawtooth")
  .lpf(400).lpq(12).ftype("ladder")
  .decay(0.2).sustain(0)
$: note("<[c4,eb4,g4] [bb3,d4,f4]>").s("sawtooth")
  .lpf(2000).attack(0.3).release(1)
  .room(0.4).gain(0.2)
```

That's a full minimal techno groove — kick, hi-hats, clap, acid bass, and a dark chord pad — in 10 lines of code. This is what you'll learn to build from scratch.

**5. Press `Ctrl+.` to stop. Start Module 1.**

### A. Strudel Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+Enter` | **Evaluate all code** — your "play/update" button |
| `Ctrl+.` | **Hush** — stop all sound instantly (emergency stop) |

> **Note:** Strudel evaluates *all* code at once — there is no block evaluation shortcut. To selectively mute parts, prefix a `$:` pattern with `_` (e.g. `_$: s("hh*8")`) to silence it.

### F. Mixing & Gain Staging

Good mixing is about **balance** — ensuring every element occupies its own space without fighting others. Here's a starting-point gain structure for Minimal Techno:

| Element | Typical Gain | Why |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| **Kick** | 0.80–0.90 | Loudest element. The anchor everything else is mixed around. |
| **Clap/Snare** | 0.60–0.70 | Clearly audible but not dominant |
| **Bass** | 0.50–0.60 | Felt more than heard — keep below kick |
| **Hi-Hats** | 0.30–0.50 | Groove, not attack. Let accent patterns provide dynamics |
| **Pad** | 0.20–0.30 | Atmospheric — felt, not focused on |
| **Lead/Melody** | 0.20–0.30 | Sparse notes + delay fill the space |
| **Percussion** | 0.25–0.35 | Texture layer, not competing |
| **Texture** | 0.05–0.10 | Almost subliminal — adds warmth/air |

**Key principles:**
- **Start with the kick** — set it at ~0.85, then mix everything else relative to it
- **Sum it mentally** — 8 elements at high gain will clip. Keep non-kick elements moderate
- **HPF everything except kick and bass** — `.hpf(200)` on pads, `.hpf(6000)` on hats removes low-end competition
- **If it sounds muddy**, turn something *down* rather than turning the kick *up*
- **Test on headphones AND speakers** — what sounds balanced on studio monitors may lack bass on earbuds

### G. Genre Variations

The skills in this course transfer to other genres. Here's how to adapt the Final Project:

**Deep House** (118–122 BPM)
```js
setcpm(120/4)
// Slower, warmer. Use TR-808 kick, triangle bass, major chords
```
- Tempo: `setcpm(120/4)` instead of `setcpm(128/4)`
- Kick: `.bank("RolandTR808")` for deep, boomy character
- Bass: `triangle` instead of `sawtooth`, shorter filter envelope
- Chords: Major or dominant 7th progressions

**Dub Techno** (120–130 BPM)
```js
// Heavy reverb, long delays, stripped percussion
.room(0.8).roomsize(0.95).roomlp(2000)
.delay(0.6).delaytime(0.375).delayfeedback(0.7)
```
- Effects: Much more reverb and delay on everything
- Percussion: Minimal — kick + sparse hats only
- Chords: Short stabs with long reverb tails

**Ambient** (no fixed tempo)
```js
setcps(0.1)  // very slow
// No kick. Generative melodies. Long pads. Focus on texture.
```
- Remove the kick entirely
- Long attack/release on everything
- Use `perlin` signals for slow, organic evolution
- Generative melodies with `irand` and heavy delay

**Drum & Bass** (170–180 BPM)
```js
setcpm(174/4)
// Breakbeat patterns, fast bass, Amen break slicing
```
- Tempo: `setcpm(174/4)` — much faster
- Drums: Use `slice()` on breakbeats instead of individual hits
- Bass: Heavier, with more `distort()` and faster filter envelopes

### I. Recording & Exporting Your Music

Strudel runs in the browser and doesn't have a built-in "export to WAV" button. Here's how to capture your work:

**Method 1: Browser Audio Recording (Simplest)**
- Use a browser extension like [Chrome Audio Capture](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-audio-capture) to record the tab's audio output directly
- Or use **OBS Studio** (free) to capture system audio

**Method 2: Screen Recording**
- Use OBS or your OS's built-in screen recorder to capture both audio and the visual code performance
- Great for sharing live coding sets on YouTube/social media

**Method 3: Strudel's Share URL**
- Click **Share** in the Strudel toolbar to generate a URL that encodes your entire code
- Anyone with the URL can open and play your exact pattern
- No audio file, but the code IS the music

**Method 4: MIDI to a DAW**
- Use `.midi()` to send your patterns to a DAW (Ableton, Reaper, etc.) via a virtual MIDI bus
- Record the MIDI and render audio in the DAW with your own synth plugins
- Best for production-quality output

**Method 5: SuperCollider Backend**
- If using [strudel-cli](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel) or a SuperCollider backend, you can record directly to WAV using SuperCollider's `s.record` function

### Guidelines

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Every code example must work.** Paste it into [strudel.cc](https://strudel.cc/), press `Ctrl+Enter`, and confirm it produces the expected sound. Broken examples break trust.

- **Match the voice.** The course is conversational, direct, and practical — not academic. Write like you're explaining to a friend.
- **Show, don't just tell.** Every concept should have a runnable code example immediately after the explanation.
- **One idea per section.** Don't cram multiple concepts into a single block.
- **Use the `$:` pattern style** for multi-element examples (consistent with Modules 7–12 and the Final Project).
- **Include `setcpm(128/4)`** in any example that relies on tempo.
- **Add exercises** with solutions in `<details>` dropdowns when possible.

### Commit Message Format
